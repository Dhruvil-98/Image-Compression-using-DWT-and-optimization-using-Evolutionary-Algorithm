# Image-Compression-using-DWT-and-optimization-using-Evolutionary-Algorithm
The proposed system based on image compression using image compression techniques and optimizing the quality of the image in order to provide the better results. The quality and the size of image data is constantly increasing. With the advancement in technology, many products in the market use images for control and display. Image compression is one of the advantageous techniques in different types of multi-media services. In this report the proposal of image compression using simple coding techniques called Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coding is done. These techniques are simple in implementation and utilize less memory. We will use Genetic algorithm to optimize the process of image compression in order to find the best possible image quality. The genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the genetic algorithm selects individuals at random from the current population to be parents and uses them to produce the children for the next generation.
